These are the data files from https://starmap.cuthalion.ca/. I'm archiving them here in case that site goes away; all credit should be given to the developer of that site as both a foundation and inspiration for this.

`update-star-systems.js` is a scuffed updater that was used to coalesce and generate data into the new formats.
